#Understanding Cloud Computing
Traditional Server Deployment (Pre-Cloud Era)
Before cloud platforms, deploying applications involved physical server acquisition:

#Purchasing Servers Globally

Buy physical servers from different regions
Manually configure network infrastructure
Directly deploy applications on physical hardware



#Challenges with Physical Server Management
Resource Inefficiencies
CopyExample Scenario:
- Needed: 1GB RAM
- Purchased: 100GB RAM Server
- Result: Significant resource wastage
Key Problems

High Costs: Expensive server procurement and maintenance
Complex Management: Intricate hardware and network configuration
Resource Underutilization: Massive unused computational capacity

#Cloud Computing: A Paradigm Shift
What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing allows organizations to:

Rent computational resources
Pay only for consumed services
Scale infrastructure dynamically

#Cloud Models
1. Private Cloud

Organizations own and manage physical servers
Complete infrastructure control
Independent deployment

2. Public Cloud

Rent servers from cloud providers
Provider manages:

Network configurations
Server maintenance
Infrastructure scaling



#Why Public Cloud Dominates
Advantages

Cost Efficiency

Lower operational expenses
Eliminate upfront hardware investments


Simplified Management

Providers handle technical complexities
Focus on core business objectives
