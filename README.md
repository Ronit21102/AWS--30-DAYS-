What is Cloud?
Before the advent of cloud platforms (over 20 years ago), deploying applications required purchasing physical servers. This involved:

Buying servers from various regions of the world.
Configuring networks manually.
Deploying applications directly to these physical servers.
Challenges with Physical Servers:
Resource Wastage: Suppose you needed only 1GB of RAM for maintenance but had to buy a 100GB RAM server. This led to unused resources.
High Costs: Purchasing and maintaining physical servers was expensive.
Complex Management: Setting up networks and maintaining hardware was difficult.
The Emergence of Cloud Platforms:
To address these issues, AWS (Amazon Web Services) introduced cloud services. AWS allowed users to:

Use only the required server capacity.
Pay for what they use, eliminating wastage and high costs.
Public vs Private Cloud
Private Cloud:
Involves buying physical servers and managing them independently.
Applications are deployed without relying on cloud providers.
Public Cloud:
Allows users to rent servers from cloud providers.
Cloud providers manage:
Network configurations
Server maintenance
Infrastructure scaling
Why is Public Cloud Better Than Private Cloud?
Cost Efficiency: Public clouds are less expensive compared to maintaining physical servers.
Ease of Use: Cloud providers handle:
Server maintenance
Network configurations
Infrastructure monitoring
This eliminates the headaches of managing physical servers.
